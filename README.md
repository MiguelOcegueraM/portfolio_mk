## What I did?
I decided to create a portfolio to put my programming skills into practice with Vue. I took Ayushman's work as a reference so as not to start from scratch and have a notion in case I get lost.

## Why Vue.js?
Currently on the market there are 3 dominant frameworks React, Angular and Vue. Vue seemed to me a simple framework and easy to implement with my knowledge as a junior developer, it is a very powerful and friendly framework with the programmer

## Try
```
git clone 

npm install
```

### Compiles and hot-reloads for development
```
npm run serve
```
